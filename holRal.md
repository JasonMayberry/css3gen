Holiday Rally 2014  Page3  
  
h1> BF 2015 DSM Plan of Action   
h2> Wednesday   
1. Pull the customer base for each of your locations and have Magic Tool files prepared to send to   each of your locations.   
2. Depending on the customer base size in each location, prepare to start marketing and setting   appointments on Thursday. We are limited to 498 messages per day (249 from store email, 249 from the SM email). For example, a location with a customer base of 2,800 will want to start marketing on Thursday. They will be able to send 498 messages on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday and finish on Wednesday. Depending on the customer base size, you will want to work with your team to make sure we are able to communicate to as many customers as we can, starting no sooner than Thursday using the tool. For stores with bases larger than 3,000, you will want to continue using the magic tool each morning throughout the sale.   
3. Keep in mind that we want to communicate right up to the beginning of the sale on Wednesday   morning, and the later we communicate the higher our results will be because we will have specific pricing. For locations with 1,500 customers or less, we don't want to start until Monday morning. Only for the larger customer bases do we want to start in advance.   
4. Along with using the Magic Tool we also want to make calls. By using phone calls and the Magic Tool   combined, we want to reach as many customers as we can to set appointments for the 5 day sale. After you have pulled each store's customer base, devise a specific plan for that location and prepare your instructions for each location individually.  
5. We want to start calling our base for additional appointments Monday afternoon once the sales   pricing has been announced. We will use the Marketing Magic Tool to send 498 messages per day before 10 a.m. Keep in mind the restrictions are based upon a 24 hour window. It will be important that these are sent out 1st thing every morning and that each store writes down the time that they were done, so they can start the following day at the time they ended the previous day.  
6. Depending on the size of the customer base, and when that location needs to begin marketing, send   one email to each store with their Marketing Magic Tool and the BF2015WSRPlanofAction document.   
7. Follow that email up with a call to the SSTM or each WSR and cover the plan for their location with   them in detail.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page4  
  
h1> Daily (Thursday- Saturday)   
  
Have the SSTM, or a designated wSR, send you a summary email daily letting you know how many messages   they have sent out. Keep track yourself to make sure the team is staying on track with the daily plan you communicated to them on Wednesday.   
  
h2> Monday   
  
1. Go to your location that will need the most help from you for their marketing. Be present in that   location for the 2 P.M. Central call announcing the sale. This will allow you to make sure this location is prepared to execute and market for the sale.  
  
2. Visit another nearby location on your way home to make sure that team is executing the marketing to   drive success during the sale.  
  
h2> Tuesday   
  
1. Kick your day off with a district wide call reviewing the plan for the day and making sure everyone   is set up for success. After your team members send out their texts, they will be making follow up calls to confirm appointments along with distributing their 100 flyers. This call will be your last opportunity to hold your team accountable to the plan. Visit the rest of your locations as needed to make sure each team is executing the marketing plan and distributing their flyers.  
  
3. Touch base with your store leaders throughout the day or have them report in group me their   progress to make sure your plan is being executed.   
  
h2> Wednesday- Monday   
You are expected to be in your stores on Wednesday, Friday and Monday supporting your busiest   locations by running the sales floor and helping them close as many sales as they can. As usual, you should be available by phone or text to answer any questions and support your team throughout the weekend.   
  
h2> Preparing your Magic Tool Files   
  
<strong>Marketing List Report:</strong> The Marketing List Report will allow you to access your stores   customer base, and export it into excel. After you do that, we will then convert it into the Magic Tool to send to your stores.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page5  
  
For locations that have been open for over 4 years, set the time frame from 11/1/2011 through   11/17/2015 to capture your customer base since the launch of RQ4. For new stores, run the report since the day the location was opened, or acquired by Russell Cellular.   
<br>  
The Marketing Magic Tool can only hold 1,000 numbers per file. Once you pull the base, be prepared to   adjust the months so that each excel file only has 1,000 numbers or less. Depending on the size of the store's customer base you may have up to 5 or 6 files per store.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page6  
  
<strong>1. Sorting the Report:</strong> Once you have pulled the report, follow the next steps to get   the information you need into excel.   
*** Scroll to the right and in the mobile number field, click in the grey square to sort the data by   mobile number. Be sure that all the mobile numbers listed from top to bottom.  
*** Click where the red arrow is on the next screenshot.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page7  
  
2. Exporting the Report:   
After the report is sorted, export it into excel by clicking the excel button on the top right of the   screen.   
   
3. Preparing your list: Once the customer data is exported into excel, highlight each mobile number   and select copy. Keep in mind that the tool only holds 1,000 numbers. Highlight 1,000 and paste them into the tool then save that file as storenamefile1. Then, paste the next 1,000 numbers and save that file as storenamefile2.   
  
*** Example: If Bolivar, MO has 2,500 customers in their base you would end up saving 3 files for that   location.   
  
4. Pasting the numbers: then paste the numbers into the Marketing Magic Tool to create your list. Run   and save a report for each of your stores. You want to make sure each store's list is accurate for that location (store city should match) and that it's sorted so that the mobile numbers are in order with no spaces/gaps in between. This will make the copy/pasting process easy for your team.   
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page8  
  
5. Saving the file: For each store you pull, save their file under a specific name for them. Based on   the amount of customers you have total, you will want to build each location's specific action plan in terms of when they being using the tool to market to their base.

Q- How do l turn it off completely?   
  
A-Hold down the lock button until "Slide to power off" appears on the screen.   
  
h2> To set up your new iphone:   
  
Do you have an itunes account?   
  
If YES, Got to Settings> scroll down to ltunes & App Store> Then, input your itunes account and   password   
  
If NO, Got to https://appleid.apple.com/account to begin!   
  
NOTE: You will need an active email address to set up the account. If you dont have an email, Gmail is   a really great.   
  
Now that you have set up your itunes account, you can go to the app store and download apps. You will   need to enter your itunes password each time you download an app, so write it down and memorize it.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page22  
  
h1> Welcome to your new Android Phone!   
After you phone is activated you must set up a g-mail account r enter an existing g-mail account to   help move your apps and contacts. Go into pre-installed apps on your new phone and find your Gmail app to set up or add your account. You must have a Gmail account set up on your phone to get any apps (free or purchased) from the Play Store.  
  
One of the most popular ways to move information into your new phone from your old is through any   existing micro sd card that may be found in your old phone. Also back up your phone to the Verizon cloud and transfer your information to the new cloud you set up in your new phone.   
  
One easy way to move information from one phone to the next is by using bluetooth. Turn on bluetooth   and make the phones "visible" and scan for other devices. Go to your old phone and select contacts, photos, or music to be switched and send it via bluetooth to your new phone. Your new phone will prompt you to accept and the transfer of information will begin.   
  
Another way to switch is the SAMSUNG SMART SWITCH APP. This app can be found in your pre-installed   apps called the play store, (it looks like a white suitcase), download the app and choose what you want moved to your new Samsung phone. This works great with all devices, especially apple products.  
  
Holiday Rally 2014  Page23  
  
If you are having trouble moving your contacts its always a great way to get your feet wet with a new   phone to enter them in manually.   
  
Photos from your old phone can be downloaded on your home computer to free up space in your new phone.   
  
If you have any questions about your new phone please try these methods first and then feel free to   call us if you need any help next week!   
  
Thanks! Renee and Laura
